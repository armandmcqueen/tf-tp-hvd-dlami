# TensorFlow + TensorPack + Horovod + Amazon EC2 Deep-learning AMI Cluster

## Pre-requisites
1. [Create and activate an AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)

2. [Manage your service limits](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/manage-service-limits/) so your EC2 service limit allows you to luanch required number of cluster instanes

3. [Install and configure AWS Command Line Interface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html)

## Create Amazon EC2 Deep-Learning AMI Cluster

[Amazon Machine Learning AMIs](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/) are an easy way for developers to launch AWS EC2 instances for machine-learning with many of the commonly used frameworks, such as TensorFlow and Keras. PyTorch, Caffe, Caffe2, Apache MXNet and Gluon, and others.

Our goal is to create a cluster of EC2 instances that we can use for distributed machine-learning using any distributed machine learning framework in general, but specifically Horovod.
